I am excited to share my latest project involving Unity, Python, and IOT. The primary language used in this project is Python, and I have devised a way to communicate through sockets. Additionally, I utilized AR technology with the help of Vuforia plugin to track an image target and position 3D objects.  For the animation part, I used Blender.
